where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

<p>Here, glslang proper means core GLSL parsing, HLSL parsing, and SPIR-V code
generation. Glslang proper requires use of two licenses, one that covers
non-preprocessing and an additional one that covers preprocessing.</p>
<p>Bison was removed long ago. You can build glslang from the source grammar,
using tools of your choice, without using bison or any bison files.</p>
<p>Other parts, outside of glslang proper, include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>gl_types.h, only needed for OpenGL-like reflection, and can be left out of
a parse and codegen project.  See it for its license.</p></li>
<li><p>update_glslang_sources.py, which is not part of the project proper and does
not need to be used.</p></li>
<li><p>the SPIR-V “remapper”, which is optional, but has the same license as
glslang proper</p></li>
<li><p>Google tests and SPIR-V tools, and anything in the external subdirectory
are external and optional; see them for their respective licenses.</p></li>
</ul>

or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.
For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal,
or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not
limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose
of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as “Not a Contribution.”</p>
<p>“Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a
Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
<p>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
<p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.</p>
<p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed
the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain
to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
Contributions.</p>
<p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the
content of the NOTICE file.</p>
<p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an
“AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such
as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only
if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting
any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
a copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
Version.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>

<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</p>

<p>Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this

<div><blockquote>
<div><p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it

versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may

<p>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version”
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</p>
