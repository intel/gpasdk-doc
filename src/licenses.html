<p>Khronos Group GLSL Reference Parser - BSD 3-clause &quot;New&quot; or &quot;Revised&quot; License</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/blob/master/LICENSE.txt</a></p>
<p>Here, glslang proper means core GLSL parsing, HLSL parsing, and SPIR-V code
generation. Glslang proper requires use of two licenses, one that covers
non-preprocessing and an additional one that covers preprocessing.</p>
<p>Bison was removed long ago. You can build glslang from the source grammar,
using tools of your choice, without using bison or any bison files.</p>
<p>Other parts, outside of glslang proper, include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>gl_types.h, only needed for OpenGL-like reflection, and can be left out of
a parse and codegen project.  See it for its license.</p></li>
<li><p>update_glslang_sources.py, which is not part of the project proper and does
not need to be used.</p></li>
<li><p>the SPIR-V &quot;remapper&quot;, which is optional, but has the same license as
glslang proper</p></li>
<li><p>Google tests and SPIR-V tools, and anything in the external subdirectory
are external and optional; see them for their respective licenses.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The core of glslang-proper, minus the preprocessor is licenced as follows:</p>

ï· updates,
ï· supplements,
ï· Internet-based services, and
ï· support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.</p>
<p>By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.</p>
<p>1.  INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
a.  Installation and Use. One user may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices to design, develop and test your programs.

<p>9.  APPLICABLE LAW.
a.  United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

b. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li><p>LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country.

<li><p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed âas-is.â You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.

This limitation applies to
ï· anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
ï· claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.</p>

engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:</p>

recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked

be required to provide such information under section 6 of the

necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application

<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from</p>

<p>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

<p>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.</p>
<p>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha" start="4">
<li><p>Do one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
Version.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>

facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your

<div><p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>

permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
