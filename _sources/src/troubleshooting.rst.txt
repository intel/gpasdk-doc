Known Issues and Limitations
=============================

2022.3
=======
- Currently, subcapture ranges cannot include frame 0 and the last frame of a stream.
- When using the screenshot layer, if a large number of screenshots are requested in close frame-intervals (every or every other frame) it is suggested to use the async=false layer flag to prevent unusually high memory connsumption and out of memory errors. This may result in a slight decrease in performance since screenshot cut and writing will be not run in async proccesses.
- Frame 0 or the setup frame cannot currently be specified as a repeat frame in gpa-player's range repeat functionality.
- Subcapture functionality only supports Direct3D 12 at this time.
- GPA CPP Generator does not support source-level generation of calls beyond the last frame delimiter in a stream.
- User input for keyframes and deferred stream capture may not be registered in certain applications. Please use time-interval keyframes and capture layer parameters for deferred stream capture.  
- When using the AMD* RX Vega card to capture a stream on a Hades Canyon machine the argument "--page-tracker-mode 2" must be added to any ./gpa-injector command in order to properly capture the stream. Note that this does not apply to the iGFX card.  
- Intel® GPA Framework has been released for Vulkan and Direct3D 12, but Direct3D 11 support is released as Beta (for example, there is no metrics collection support on non-Intel GPUs yet), and is subject to change.
- At present, the Intel® GPA Framework contains only Release builds (no debug builds of libraries).  
- The capture layer supports only 64-bit applications. However, the injection mechanism will work with 32-bit processes for the purpose of allowing the capture of applications that require 32-bit launchers.  
- A modification of shaders in HLSL representation can cause the gpa-player to crash if the original shader representation was different from HLSL (Vulkan).  
- Support is not provided yet for collecting query-based metrics from Vulkan transfer queues. When used, they are ignored by the MetricsExtractor when the graphics API pipeline statistics based query managers are used, but are accepted by the Intel Hardware Metrics Discovery library query manager which may return metrics results. No validation of such results have occurred.
